# Chokidar
A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile.

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on mac
* Sometimes report events twice on mac
* Has only one non-useful event: `rename`
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/search?utf8=âœ“&q=fs.watch)

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Doesn't work on windows
* Almost as shitty in event tracking.

Chokidar resolves this problems.

It is used in [brunch](http://brunch.io) and had proven itself in production env.

## Getting started
Install chokidar via node.js package manager:

    npm install chokidar


Then just require the package in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

var watcher = chokidar('file or dir', options);

watcher
  .on('add', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been added');})
  .on('change', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been changed');})
  .on('unlink', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been removed');})
  .on('error', function(error) {console.error('Error happened', error);})

```

## Watcher API
* `constructor`: constructor takes paths to be watched and options.
Right now only `options.ignored` is supported. It's a RegExp or function against
which all added files will be checked. Example that will ignore dotfiles:
`chokidar('file', ignored: /^\./)`
* `.add(file / files)`: add directories / files for tracking.
Takes an array of strings (file paths) or just one path.
* `.on(event, callback)`: listen for an FS event.
Available events: add, change, unlink, error.
* `.close()`: remove all listeners from watched files.
